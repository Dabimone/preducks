**preducks** is a visual prototyping tool for developers employing **React** component architecture and **Redux** state management, alongside the comprehensive type checking of **TypeScript**.
In other words, **you can draw prototypes and export React / Typescript code!**

**preducks** allows the user to _visualize_ their application architecture dynamically, employing an _application tree_ and a _real-time component code preview_. The user can create components and load _instances_ of these components, as well as nested HTML elements, onto the canvas. The user can also specify the desired shape of their _Redux store_ and _reducers_, as well as _interfaces_ to describe the desired shape of their data, and connections between their components and the store using _Redux hooks_. This architecture can then be _exported_ as TypeScript application files to be used as a starter template for any repository.
